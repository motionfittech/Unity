{
  // This scene requires both an avatar and a graph. Add in buttons to switch between avatar view and graph view. 

  // The Avatar view will assign a color to the avatar shader. 
  
  // If the tensorflow model outputs fatigue of 1-6, it's green shader. 

  // If the tensorflow model outputs fatigue of 6-8, it's a yellow shader.

  // If the tensorflow model outputs fatigue of 8-10, it's a red shader. 

  //The bar graphs will have smaller bars for low fatigue and taller bars for high fatigue. 

  // Fatigue, Muscle Imbalances, Distance, Calories Burned and Reps screens all need a "Return to Workout Screen" Button.
